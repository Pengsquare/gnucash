These files are used for testing loading and saving

If the "load-save-files" test fails because the written XML file is now
different, zcat *.gnucash-compressed~ to *.gnucash, check that the changes
are appropriate, expected and have the right backward/forward compatibility
then commit the new versions of the files.
